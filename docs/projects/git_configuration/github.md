!!! Note
    This documentation is still a work in progress


Like the [Gitlab Repository](gitlab.md) feature of this ansible role, you can manage the full lifecycle of your Github repository. Running this role from the CLI includes the github management, however if you wish to manage your Github repositories only, use the `--tags` arg with a value of `github`
