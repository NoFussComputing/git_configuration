!!! Note
    This documentation is still a work in progress


## Docs ToDo

- notate that the ansible-ee container has this included
- notate that this is also included in our ansible roles repo.

!!! Tip
    When using our [Ansible Execution Environment Docker Container](../execution_environment/index.md) `nofusscomputing/ansible-ee` this role is included as part of that containers build.

!!! Tip
    This role is also included in our [Ansible Roles](../ansible-roles/index.md) git repository.
